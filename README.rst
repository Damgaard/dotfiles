Dot Files
=========

My personal dotfiles for personal and professional use.

Reason to exist
---------------

I work and develop on multiple different machines, it is important for my
productivity that I have a consistent environment everywhere. So I can focus
on the work and not on fighting the environment.

To make this happen, I've put dotfiles into this repository which I then
pull down on each relevant machine.

Design
------

I use these dotfiles on production machines. For stability and reliability
only absolutely neccessary packages and installed there. Therefore this repo
only has bash and git as dependencies and install nothing from external
sources.

Setup
-----

After pulling the latest version of the repo, the files need to be symlinked
from the home directory of the relevant user. This process is currently manual.

Inspiration

And others, whose great dotfiles I've unfortunately forgotten to write down.

Systems
-------

I currently only work in Ubuntu environments of version 12.04 or higher. Since
I don't work on other Operating systems, it may or may not work on other
systems.
